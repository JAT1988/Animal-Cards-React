      Well, I got better. Found them? In Mercia?! The coconut's tropical! I
      dunno. Must be a king. …Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? Why? You
      don't vote for kings. On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a
      silly place. Where'd you get the coconuts? We shall say 'Ni' again to you,
      if you do not appease us. I don't want to talk to you no more, you
      empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction!
      Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave
      before I am forced to taunt you a second time! Ah, now we see the violence
      inherent in the system! Why? Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the
      system! Help, help, I'm being repressed! I don't want to talk to you no
      more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general
      direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of
      elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time! You
      can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a
      sword at you! She looks like one. Shut up! What do you mean? Bloody
      Peasant! The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or
      the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers
      to our land. We found them. Oh, ow! Well, I didn't vote for you. Who's
      that then? Did you dress her up like this? …Are you suggesting that
      coconuts migrate? Well, what do you want? It's only a model. She looks
      like one. Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system! Camelot! The
      Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft
      Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence
      that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king. Now,
      look here, my good man. Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who
      seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. Bring her forward! Well,
      Mercia's a temperate zone! Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who
      seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. Well, I got better. Be
      quiet! But you are dressed as one… The nose? …Are you suggesting that
      coconuts migrate? The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house
      martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not
      strangers to our land. No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart.

      witch? Found them? In Mercia?! The coconut's tropical! The Lady of the

      from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I,

      He hasn't got shit all over him. Who's that then? We shall say 'Ni' again
